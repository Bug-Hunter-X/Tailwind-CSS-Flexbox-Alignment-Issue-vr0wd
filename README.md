# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Alignment Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `flex` utility class.  The problem involves unexpected behavior when placing multiple divs within a flex container, resulting in improper alignment or overlapping elements.  A solution is provided to correct this behavior.

## Bug Description

The issue arises due to the default behavior of flexbox containers. Without explicitly defining how flex items should align and distribute space, unexpected layout results can occur.  This is demonstrated in the `bug.js` file. The two divs do not take up the full available space, resulting in an unexpected layout. 

## Solution

The solution involves using additional Tailwind CSS utilities to control the alignment and distribution of the flex items.  This ensures the elements align as expected and occupy the available space.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
